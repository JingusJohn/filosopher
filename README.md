# Filosopher

It's got a dumb name, but a great experience.

Local, self-hosted fileserver with explorer.

# Plans

The user should be able to create an account (if config enabled) and sign in. Upon sign in, they will be able to manage their own collectino of files in a MinIO BLOB storage container. In the future, It should have a more robust solution. MinIO is just easy and a good start. Being able to support data replication and redundancy might not be feasible with MinIO.
